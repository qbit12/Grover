The highest-coherence qubits that we can make today have a coherence time of ~ 100 microseconds. We may also wan to optimize the number of operations we can fit within that time.

    "   1-Cancel the superposition by a layer of H gate\n",
    "\n",
    "   2-Multiply the amplitude of the $|0>_n$ state by -1, this is called a mirror operation $M_0=X^{\\otimes n} M_1 X^{\\otimes n}$.\n",
    "    \n",
    "   3-Restoring the superposition by another layer of H gate called $A^\\dagger$, which increases the probability of seeing the desired state.\n",
    "    \n",
    "The overall effect is $D=-AM_0A^\\dagger$ in the standard version of Grover's algorithm $A=H$ whereas in this paper [[1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.06468)] they assign to it another operation; whereby their main achievement is a generalization of the inversion about the mean step, thus rather than canceling the superposition they go forward to another state that makes the reflection easier. They succeeded to combine the action of the first layer of step 1 $H^{\\otimes n}$ with the first layer of step 2 $X^{\\otimes n}$ into a more efficient operator B where the Grover diffuser turn into $D=B^\\dagger M_B B$. They supposed an operator B such that $BA=X^{\\otimes n}$, then $A^\\dagger=X^{\\otimes n} B$ and $A=B^\\dagger X^{\\otimes n}$ then the Grover diffusion becomes: $$\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "D &=A M_{0} A^{\\dagger} \\\\\n",
    "&=B^{\\dagger} X^{\\otimes n} M_{0} X^{\\otimes n} B \\\\\n",
    "&=B^{\\dagger} X^{\\otimes n} X^{\\otimes n} M_{1} X^{\\otimes n} X^{\\otimes n} B \\\\\n",
    "&=B^{\\dagger} M_{1} B\n",
    "\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "In this case, $M_B=M_1$, which uses fewer gates than $M_0$, therefore avoid the $X$ gates on either side of the multi-control gate. The modified version of the algorithm set $B=R_x(\\pi/2)$ and $B^\\dagger=R_x(-\\pi/2)$; in general this leads to save $2n$ X gates per mirror operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence the modification is as follow: $HX \\rightarrow R_x(\\pi/2)$ and $X^\\dagger H^\\dagger \\rightarrow R_x(-\\pi/2)$\n",
    "\n",
    "The preparation layer is also replaced: $H \\rightarrow R_x(\\pi/2)$\n",
    "\n",
    "And now let's do a comparison between the boolean Grover's circuit and phase+modified Grover's circuit by evaluating the circuit depth, widht and quantum cost ( this latter is done by the transpiler where it is the procedded step before running the circuit on the quantum hardware, it does 2 main things: \n",
